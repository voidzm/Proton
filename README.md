Proton is a mod for Minecraft. It is still in the development / testing phase, so I am not yet supporting the mod nor releasing a built .jar file.

If you are interested in building the source code for yourself, put the contents of this repository in a folder called "proton". You also need the repository voidzm/Novamenu in a folder called "novamenu" next to the "proton" folder. Both of these should be in a folder called "projects" which needs to be next to your "forge" folder. If you've done that, just run "build_proton.bat". That should work, but no guarantees. If you care enough to go through that, you should already know what you're doing.
